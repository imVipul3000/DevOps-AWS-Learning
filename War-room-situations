Networking/Latency - 
1. A Tesla service depends on Kafka + Redis. Both look healthy but requests are intermittently failing. What’s your debug path before escalating to app teams?
2. You see a gradual increase in latency across an NGINX ingress, but CPU/memory are stable. What’s your next move?
3. 30% of Tesla Superchargers in Europe report “backend unavailable”, but cloud dashboards show all green. How would you isolate whether it’s DNS, TLS, or routing drift?
4. Your team reports slow API response times, but CPU, memory, and request volume look stable. What non-obvious infra metrics do you check before suspecting the app layer?
5. Payments API latency spikes by 600ms only in one region. No new deploys. DNS propagation, load balancers, and instances are all healthy. Where do you start your RCA?
6. During a deployment, gRPC connections start randomly timing out. Load balancer metrics show normal traffic. How do you debug this at OSI layer 4 and below, and how do you isolate it between Envoy, network stack, and kernel sockets?
7. You’ve got an intermittent 10-second delay in cart updates only for Android app users. Where do you start: CDN, API gateway, client SDK, DB lock, or cache churn?
8. Explain your approach to debugging DNS resolution inside pods when CoreDNS itself looks healthy.
9. An ALB is marked healthy, but 20% of requests return 502s. How do you isolate whether it’s the target group, the NLB hop, or the app?
10. A customer reports latency only in ap-south-1. All dashboards are green. What do you check at the VPC + network layer?


Debug - 
1. How would you debug a pod stuck in “ContainerCreating” during deployment? What are your next 3 CLI commands?
2. You deployed a Cilium update, and suddenly inter-pod communication breaks for one namespace. What’s your triage approach to confirm root cause?
3. One app’s pods restart daily at 2 AM - no crash loops, no OOMs. Where do you start: CronJobs, readiness probes, HPA events, or the node scheduler?
4. During an overnight release, an Ansible playbook wipes a shared NFS mount. How do you triage, contain, and recover without triggering client downtime?
5. Your Kubernetes cluster’s etcd snapshot restore works, but pods don’t reconcile properly afterward. What’s your recovery approach?
6. A new container image passed CI but failed readiness probes in production. No logs, no crashloops - just hangs. How would you debug this, step by step?
7. During an SRE review, your system passes SLO targets but still experiences user complaints. What hidden reliability gaps could explain this discrepancy?
8. Your Kubernetes nodes intermittently go NotReady during morning trading hours, but kubelet logs look clean. What’s your investigation path: node OS, CNI, control-plane, or market load pattern?
9. EBS volumes detach mid-transaction under high I/O bursts. What kernel-level or IOPS-limit behaviors can trigger this, and how would you design retries to avoid data corruption?
10. User posts intermittently fail to appear on feeds across regions. You trace it to replication lag in MySQL shards, but CPU and IO look fine. What’s your deep-dive debugging path from schema to kernel?
11. A misconfigured service mesh policy causes mTLS handshake failures across 1,200 pods. Describe your live RCA: what metrics do you check, what gets rolled back, and how do you communicate impact internally?
12. During an OS release, global TLS cert rotation misfires. Some services use stale certs. How do you coordinate atomic certificate rotation across tens of thousands of microservices without downtime?
13. Persistent volumes (EBS) attach to pods, but randomly enter read-only mode under load. What would you trace at the kernel level or CSI driver, and how?
14. During a Flipkart flash sale, K8s pods fail liveness probes at scale. Turns out the sidecar metrics exporter is spiking CPU. Your RCA and live hotfix?
15. How would you auto-scale GPU nodes for training workloads while ensuring you don’t waste $30–$40/hour on idle GPUs?
16. Persistent storage for datasets starts spiking at 200ms+ latency. How do you identify whether the issue is in the storage backend, VPC networking, or the GPU node pipeline?
17. Kafka consumer lag shoots up after a canary rollout, but CPU/memory metrics are normal. Where do you start?
18. HPA is scaling pods, but they remain Pending even with node capacity. Cluster vs scheduler vs CNI, how do you debug?
19. What happens when systemd units fail intermittently on EKS nodes? How do you detect and heal?



Security - 
1. What’s your approach to handling secrets rotation in Kubernetes and CI/CD environments?

Design - 
1. Describe your zero-downtime strategy for rolling out config changes to Nginx ingress across 500+ services, when 20% of traffic is long-lived HTTP connections.
2. Meta serves billions of requests per second. How would you design a distributed load-balancing system that guarantees tail latency below 100ms globally without relying on external CDNs?
3. Apple services push iOS updates to billions of devices simultaneously. How do you design a staged rollout system that balances global consistency with regional reliability, while preventing thundering herd download storms?
4. You’re managing 2000+ K8s nodes across clusters. Walk us through zero-downtime CRI upgrades without draining the entire node group.
5. Flipkart’s growth team wants new APIs pushed globally, but compliance says “India only”. How do you architect region-aware routing, identity, and data isolation?
6. How would you design zero-downtime rollouts for 100+ microservices running on EKS?
7. Netflix runs multi-cloud. Describe your approach to cross-cloud routing, IAM, and secret syncing.


Straight forward - 
1. Walk me through what kube-proxy does when IPVS rules vanish mid-traffic.
2. Terraform apply failed mid-way. Half the infra is live, half broken. Walk me through recovery.
3. etcd corruption detected in a multi-master control plane. Walk through recovery without full downtime.
4. How would you debug intermittent DNS failures inside an EKS cluster using CoreDNS?
